# SPEC SHEET FOR HUNGA-8

Hunga-8 will be 16-bit computer with a ROM Controller to have more Program Memory.
This means you can't chnage any Program Memory when Hunga-8 is running.

### Pogram Memory Layout

0x0000 - 0xFFFF: Program Memory  (BANKED)

Allows for a total of 65536 programs loaded on this computer.
With a total of 16-bits to for setting Bank Number.

### Computer Memory Layout

0x0000...0x3FFF: GP ROM Memory        -> 32   KB  (BANKED)
0x4000...0xBFFF: GP RAM Memory        -> 64   KB

## Frame Data Strage Format

Video Memory is divded into 2:
	-- CM 0xC500...0xC5FF
	-- CR 0x0000...0xFFFF

CM 0xC500 to 0xC5FF is used to store 128 chars of 8x8 sprites.
Each Char is stored over 32bits (2Regs), reg 1 for storing the char number and z-index. reg 2 for storting the data of position.

REG 1:

|----------||------|
10bits      6bits
For Char    For ZI

REG 2:

|--||-------||-------|
2BI   8Bits    8Bits
Nan   X pos    Y pos

According to the char ID the GPU (c++ based) look at a table in the char sheet in Video memory to get the a string of 128bits with tell if a pixel is transparent, Black, White.

The colors are refpersented by 2bit:

00: Black
01: White
10: transparent
11: Unused

EG for a char sheet:

00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 01 01 00 00 00
00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00
00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00
00 00 01 01 01 01 00 00
00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00
00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00
00 00 01 00 00 01 00 00

This is a char sheet for A.
